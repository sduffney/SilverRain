5. Best Practices & Usage Tips

Use Lowest Shader for mobile games or large crowds (NPCs, enemies).

Use Option Shader for main characters or bosses to enhance detail.

For cel look: set _UseShadeThreshold = 1, tweak _ShadeThreshold ~0.5.

Outline width depends on mesh scale. Start with 0.02 ‚Äì 0.05.

Combine with gradient textures for unique stylized effects.

6. Troubleshooting

Shader not showing up?

Make sure URP is set up in your project.

Check that materials use the correct shader (Custom/MonsterCelShaderLowest or Custom/MonsterCelShaderOption).

Outline too thin?

Increase _OutlineWidth = 0 until visible.

No shading effect?

Set _UseShadeThreshold to 1.

Adjust _ShadeThreshold and _ShadeIntensity for desired effect.
